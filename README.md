# Palindrome

Palindrome, according to Merriam Webster dictionary, is “a word, verse, or sentence (such as "Able was I ere I saw Elba") or a number (such as 1881) that reads the same backward or forward”.

This program uses stack and queue data structures to check whether the given input is a palindrome. 


In this program, the maximum capacity of the stack and the queue are as follows:
Maximum size of the stack: half the size of the input rounded down.
Maximum size of the queue: half the size of the input rounded up.

The program is able to handle different types of inputs, e.g., Integer and string.
